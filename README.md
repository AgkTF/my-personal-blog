# AgkTF's Blog 📝 🚀

This is my personal blog. The area of topics it will cover is so vast, it ranges from web development, programming in general to anything **tech** related and my personal opinions sometimes.

## Do you want a copy? 😄

Of course, this is my personal blog but this community has given me so much already so if you like what you see you can fork it and play with it the way you see fit.

### Technologies used

This blog was built using an amazing set of technologies:

-   [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/)

    > Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps

-   [React](http://gatsbyjs.org/) - Of course, the well-known JavaScript front-end library.

-   Markdown - For creating the posts itself.
-   [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - the amazing css framework that I love working with.
    > Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 200,000 developers.

### Prerequisites

Being built with gatsby, you should install gatsby CLI using npm or yarn. For me, I prefer yarn.

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

```
yarn add gatsby-cli
```

Then follow the instructions shown in the official docs of gatsby
[Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

You should have NodeJs and ReactJs installed on your system, I think that goes without saying.

## Last words & Acknowledgments

-   I really appreciate the gatsby core developers and community for such great support and plugins and I hope one day I contribute to this awesome technology.

-   Bulma is love 💟. Thanks, bulma.
